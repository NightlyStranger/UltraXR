1. Basic visualization of volumes 
in engine of choice 
2. Basic visualization of meshes 
in engine of choice 
3. Combination of volumes and meshes 
if it is possible by performance
4. Basic visualization of
ultrasound machine in engine of choice
5. Rendering into texture from points 
1--3 to be displayed in 4
6. Modification of ultrasound
machine model with
structure-from-motion (if we even can 
do that legally) 
7. Animations and modelling for 
ultrasound machine control
8. Display of transducer in the setup
9. Connecting the transducer
tracking with the engine 10. 
OPTIONAL: attempt to use streamed data
for rendering in 1. according to 
transducer position 9.
1. Optinal: consider fluid
information visualization
